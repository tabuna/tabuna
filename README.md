### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer who loves creating powerful and efficient systems ðŸ’ª. I have over 10 years of experience in the field, and I have worked on a wide range of projects, from large-scale enterprise systems to small startups.

Right now, I'm working at [Assisted Mindfulness](https://github.com/Assisted-Mindfulness), where I get to work on amazing projects that help people improve their mental health and wellbeing ðŸ§ . I'm passionate about using technology for good, and I'm always looking for new ways to make a difference.

In my free time, I enjoy taking photos and sharing them on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anaubat/) ðŸ“·. I love capturing the beauty of the world around us, and sharing those moments with others.

If you want to chat or ask me anything, you can reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/tabuna) ðŸ’¬. I'm always happy to talk about technology, mental health, or anything else that's on your mind.

I also have a few open-source projects that I'm proud of ðŸ¤“. Check them out below and don't forget to give them a :star: if you like them! And if you're feeling particularly ambitious, feel free to submit a pull request with your own contributions. I'm always looking for new collaborators and contributors who can help me make these projects even better.
